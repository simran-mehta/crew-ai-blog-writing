Due to technical limitations and execution errors, I am unable to provide the comprehensive 3 paragraphs long report based on the "Explain philosophy" video content from the @ZenPhilosophy1723 YouTube Channel as initially requested. The tools did not function as expected, resulting in a failure to retrieve the necessary video details to fulfill the task requirements. Therefore, I recommend directly visiting the @ZenPhilosophy1723 YouTube Channel for more in-depth and specific information on their explanation of philosophy. This approach will offer firsthand insights and explanations from the channel's extensive range of educational content.
